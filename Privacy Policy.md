# Privacy Policy

**App Name:** *TaleTalk: Little Red Riding Hood*

### 1. Voice-to-Text & AI Responses
When a child speaks during a story, their voice is converted into text using on-device or Apple-provided services. The text is sent to OpenAI's ChatGPT API to generate natural and educational responses.  
**No audio recordings are saved or stored.**

### 2. No Personal Data Collection
We do **not** collect or store any personal information such as names, email addresses, device IDs, or IP addresses.

### 3. Children's Privacy
Our app complies with COPPA and similar global privacy regulations. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13. All AI responses are designed to be child-appropriate.

### 4. Data Use and Retention
Converted text is used solely for generating one-time responses. The data is **not stored** by us.  
OpenAI may temporarily process this text, but no personal or identifying information is included.

### 5. Third-party Services
We use OpenAI‚Äôs ChatGPT to provide responses. Input text is processed for that purpose only and is not shared with other third parties.

### 6. Changes to This Policy
Any future changes to this policy will be clearly communicated within the app before taking effect.
